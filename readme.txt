WP Auctions is a revolutionary plugin for WordPress which allows you to host auctions on your blog and to sell ANYTHING, completely fee free!

You no longer need to worry about listing fees, seller fees, final value fees, gallery fees or any other type of fee for anything you want to sell online from this day on! Once you list your auctions, you can register your plugin with the WP Auctions Live page and generate some traffic for your website. Have a look at some existing auctions at http://www.wpauctions.com/live/

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working well on my blog. What could the problem be? =

The plugin uses the Prototype Javascript library. Some other libraries (particularly mootools) break this. Try to disable other plugins to see if that will fix the problem.

= Can I add other photos to my auction? =

Not with this version. However, v2.0 has this feature, as well as other great options. Read more about it here: http://www.wpauctions.com/
