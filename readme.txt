WP Auctions is an auction engine for WordPress blogs allowing you to host auctions on your blog and to sell ANYTHING, completely fee free! It uses an attractive Web 2.0 popup for optimum user experience and lets you run your very own auction site.

== Description ==

WP Auctions is a revolutionary plugin for WordPress which allows you to host auctions on your blog and to sell ANYTHING, completely fee free!

You no longer need to worry about listing fees, seller fees, final value fees, gallery fees or any other type of fee for anything you want to sell online from this day on! Once you list your auctions, you can register your plugin with the WP Auctions Live page and generate some traffic for your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working well on my blog. What could the problem be? =

The plugin uses the Prototype Javascript library. Some other libraries (particularly mootools) break this. Try to disable other plugins to see if that will fix the problem.

= Can I add other photos to my auction? =

Not with this version. However, the Gold version has this feature, as well as other great options. Read more about it here: http://www.wpauctions.com/

= What other features are available in the Gold version? =

The Gold version has tons of enhancements and improvements. Here are some of our favourite ones:
* A choice of 5 different visual styles
* Auctions for registered users only. 
* Accept PayPal, wire transfers or checks. 
* Sell items on "Buy It Now" basis
* Upload multiple images for each auction
* Place auctions in a post or page. 
* Show ads if no auctions are available
* Specify shipment surcharges and options
But don't worry, the Free version is always under development too, so we're committed to improving it and fixing any bugs.
