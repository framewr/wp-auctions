== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working well on my blog. What could the problem be? =

The plugin uses the jQuery Javascript library and was coded with best practices so as not to conflict with your theme or other plugins. To check where the problem could be, try to disable your other plugins and see if that will fix the problem.

= Why do my images not show up? =

This could be due to a number of factors, but mostly due to the fact that the "files" folder needs to be CHMOD 777 in order to save your images. We've included links to instructions in the backend area, under the "Add" screen, on how to do it.

= How do I insert HTML as part of my description? =

Simple, here's an example of a paragraph:

&lt;p&gt;Your text comes here&lt;/p&gt;

There are specific instructions for you under the description entry box on the "Add" screen as well.

= How do I insert a video as part of my description? =

To include *one* video you have to adjust the width and height of the embed code to **width="324" height="254"**.

If you are going to include text and videos, then your description area will get scroll bars, in this case you have to adjust the width of the embed code to **width="304"**, the height can whatever you like.

= Why does the AJAX popup look weird on my blog? =

This could be due to the CSS of your theme. While we try to override reset settings for the popup CSS there are some instances where themes have been known to override our CSS settings. Yes, it's a vicious cycle. To fix it, try and edit the CSS of the theme if you are comfortable doing so or ask for help on the forums.

= What features are available in the Pro version? =

The Pro and Pro Plus versions have tons of enhancements and improvements. Here are some of our favourte ones:

* 3 bidding engines to choose from: Proxy, Simple & Reverse
* Auctions for registered users only. 
* Set a reserve price for your auctions
